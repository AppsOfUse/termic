// What colour the PR glyph on a task row takes, and whether it is an alarm.
//
// A pure function rather than a ternary chain inside TaskPrBadge, because the
// rules here are easy to break by accident ("a draft never takes a colour",
// "nothing on this glyph is ever the alarm red") and this repo has no
// component-render setup: the choices are a real unit test on a function or a
// regex over the component's source.
//
// NEVER --color-err, deliberately. That is the colour the app uses for "this
// is broken right now". A failing build on an open PR is something to go and
// look at, not a failure of the task the row represents, and a closed PR is
// inert rather than broken. A list dotted with alarm red that you are not
// meant to act on is how you teach someone to stop seeing red at all.
//
// Closed still has to read as closed, though. For a while it was plain faint,
// and with the sidebar's default number-only mark that made a closed PR, a
// draft and a PR nobody has looked up yet the same grey number, told apart
// only by the tooltip. So closed takes its own muted red (--color-pr-closed)
// and a struck-through number: dead, not on fire.
