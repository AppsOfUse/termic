// Slot math and the per-pass decision for recurring schedules (GH #300).
//
// Pure: no store, no IPC, no clock of its own. Everything takes `now`, which
// is what lets the runner's tests (and the e2e seam) drive a pass at any
// moment without waiting for 09:00.
//
// Local wall-clock time throughout, the same clock scheduled queue messages
// use (`localDateValue` in lib/scheduledQueue.ts). A slot is built with the
// `Date(y, m, d, h, min)` constructor, which is also the whole DST story:
//   - the hour that does not exist when clocks go forward is rolled forward
//     by `Date` (02:30 becomes 03:30), with no special code;
//   - the hour that repeats when clocks go back cannot fire twice, because a
//     day has ONE slot and a pass only acts on a slot later than `last_slot`.
